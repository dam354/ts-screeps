# [Screeps AI: TypeScript Edition]

Screeps AI: TypeScript Edition is a custom AI for Screeps, leveraging TypeScript for more robust and maintainable code. This project extends the Screeps Typescript Starter by introducing additional utilities for creep task management and execution.

## Screeps To-Do List

### Creep Management

- [ ] Develop and refine creep roles for efficient task execution based on environmental conditions.
- [ ] Implement a dynamic task/goal assignment system for generic creeps adaptable to changing colony needs.
- [ ] Enhance the logic for creeps to switch tasks/goals as per the colony's current requirements.

### Automatic Spawning

- [ ] Create an advanced headcount system for automatic creep replacement and adjustment based on colony needs.
- [ ] Implement Part-Count Balancing to optimize creep sizes and roles in relation to current resource demands.
- [ ] Develop a robust spawn queue system for efficient and prioritized creep production.
- [ ] Design a cold-boot mechanism to ensure colony recovery and restart in case of total creep loss.

### Automatic Room Defense

- [ ] Set up and refine tower defense strategies for optimal effectiveness against invaders and enemy users.
- [ ] Develop creep-based defense strategies, including rampart-defenders and active-counter measures.
- [ ] Implement repair spam tactics to counteract enemy damage during invasions.
- [ ] Integrate SafeMode activation in critical scenarios for temporary invulnerability.

### Energy Harvesting and Remote Mining

- [ ] Optimize energy harvesting strategies to maximize resource utilization (Kardashev scale approach).
- [ ] Establish efficient remote mining operations for supplementing main room energy resources.
- [ ] Develop methods for harvesting and hauling resources from highway locations and Source-Keeper rooms.
- [ ] Implement advanced scouting and information storage techniques for identifying and exploiting resource opportunities.

### Market and Resource Management

- [ ] Automate market interactions for buying/selling resources and acquiring first credits.
- [ ] Set up lab logic and boost production for enhanced creep abilities and efficiency.
- [ ] Create an automated factory system for commodity production and market exchange.

### Advanced Strategies and Room Expansion

- [ ] Develop offensive strategies for room acquisition and enemy colony engagement.
- [ ] Implement intershard operations for expanded colony influence and resource acquisition.
- [ ] Automate stronghold attacks for resource gain and strategic advantages.

### Pathfinding and Room Planning

- [ ] Optimize pathfinding algorithms and caching for efficient creep movement.
- [ ] Automate room planning and building for efficient base development and expansion.
